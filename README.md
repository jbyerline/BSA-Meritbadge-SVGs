# BSA Meritbadge SVG Icons and PDF Workbooks
This is a repository containing SVG files and PDF workbooks for every BSA merit badge (139 badges as of 2023)

I did not make these images or workbooks, nor do I own them. I simply collected them and placed them in a common repository for easier access and public reference. 

If new badges come out in the future, please feel free to open a PR against this repo to add in the new SVG and PDF file

These images came from:
https://www.scouting.org/programs/scouts-bsa/advancement-and-awards/merit-badges/

This website was replaced with the current merit badge website on October 2021. You can now only find caches of these images here:

For reference, here is the current website which does not include the SVG images: https://www.scouting.org/skills/merit-badges/all/
